Cost Function:
- Hypothesis function can be simplified by removing the y intercept:
 - h_{\theta}(x) = \theta_0 \thimes x
-> minimize_{\theta} \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m(\theta \times x_i - y_i)^2

Hypothesis:
- direct mapping of y as a function of x

Cost function:
- Mapping of cost as a function of parameter \theta
- this is a porabola that we are trying to find the smallest point

Contour plots or figures:
- keeping both \theta still gives you a prabola but in 2 dimentions ( it's a 3D bow like shape)
- Remember the goals is to come up with an automatic algorothm to find that minima
- or in the other words to find the center of that concentric contours
