Choice of features matter:
- Maybe we can combine certain features into one
- Maybe we can break a certain feature into several
- See what kind of model makes sense:
 - Quadratic won't make sense for pricing since it goes back down
 - See if the model makes sense with the problem at hand
 - Pick features accordingly
 - We don't have to neccessarily introduce new features, just set feature x_2 = x_1^2
  - be careful about scaling problem which was covered earlier

- \theta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
- if X^TX is not invertable
 1- Redundant features
  - Get rid of them
 2- Too many features for the number of examples (M \leq N)
  - Regularize the features
