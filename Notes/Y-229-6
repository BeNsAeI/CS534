Feature Scaling
- Make sure features are on a similar scale
 - Otherwise the contours look very skinny and tall
 - scale them and give them a value from 0 to 1
- Get every feature to -1 to 1 range
 - close enough is good enough!
 - you can scale down OR scale up to achieve this

mean normalization:
- shift the values based on mean
 - This helps with putting the values from -1 to 1
 - x - \mu / standard diviation
