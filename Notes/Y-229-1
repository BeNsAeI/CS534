* Machinelearning algorithms use experience E, to predict task T with probability P

Types of machine learning problems:
- Superwised
- Unsuperwised
- Reindorcement

Superwise learning:
- Most common type of ML
- A data set of correct answers need to be given in order to learn how to make predictions
- A regression problem: predict a continueus value number
- Classification: discrete value output(0,1,..,n)
- feature or attributes are data input "clues"
- you cam use infinite number of features and attributes

Unsuperwised learning:
- We don't know the data's nature and trying to find a structure in it
 - Clustering algorithm (classification without knowing the answer)
  - news classification, favorite movies, gene classification of DNA, etc
 - SVD
  - Coctail party problem

 - svd: single value decomposition (octave)
