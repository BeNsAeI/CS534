2018-12-05 from 0930 to 1120 in Wiegand Hall 115

Here are some basic information regarding the final exam:
1. Final covers content after the midterm. I want to mention, however, it is not possible to have a completely clean cut because some concepts are introduced in the first half of the class but are continuously visited throughout the class. Such concepts will not be excluded. For example, the concept of overfitting, the concept of maximum likelihood estimation etc.  In other words, when studying for the final, you should focus on the materials (slides and reading and assignments etc) after the midterm, but if you need a refresher on some concepts from before the midterm, do go back to the old slides to make sure you are comfortable with these concepts.
2. Rules are the same as the midterm. You will have a cheat-sheet that is one sided and letter size.
3. You will not need nor will you be allowed to use any electronic device including calculator for your exam.
4. The location of the exam will not be in the regular classroom. I am working with the staff to schedule a larger room, please wait for further announcement regarding the location.
5. I will hold office hour on Tuesday 1-2pm.

Just a reminder that tomorrow’s exam will be held 9:30 – 11:20 in Wiegand Hall 115, which is in a different building than our regular one despite a familiar sounding name.

See the following map for where the building is (highlighted in red).
